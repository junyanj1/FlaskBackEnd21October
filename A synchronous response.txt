## A synchronous response ##
The problem: We want a synchronous response facing client request, but the API server relies on 
another service to complete the pipeline.

Since the pipeline does not take too much time to run on average and needs to be served synchronously, 
I propose to:
    a. label each pipeline run with timestamp and clientId on the API server
    b. send the pipeline label along with other information to "another service" that starts the pipeline script
    c. once the pipeline is done, publish the "pipeline label: result" pair in an in-memory database
    d. let the API server to check the in-memory database with corresponding pipeline labels periodically
    e. if the result is published, return it as the synchronous response and delete that entry from the database
